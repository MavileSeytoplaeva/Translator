The aim of the project is to help philology students to ease and shorten the time of writing down every word and its
definition.

Steps:
1. Apps controls the keyboard and when noticing CTRL + C copies the word or a word combination to a Data Base
2. Then uses a API Translator and translates the word and writes down the definition in the second column
3. There will be a function of the app to reformat DataBase to file.


--KeyboardListener Branch

1. Connected a DB with an app
2. DB fills with info by endpoints and sql (just to check if is working)
3. Wrote some simple save and delete methods for DB just to check
4. Worked wholly on DB at that moment
5. Next step should be the connection of KeyListener and DB
